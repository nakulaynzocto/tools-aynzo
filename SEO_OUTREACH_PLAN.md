*   **Maker Comment (First Comment):**
    > "Hey Product Hunt! 👋 
    > We built Aynzo Tools because we were tired of using 'free' online utilities that were either bloated with intrusive ads or required us to upload sensitive data to unknown servers.
    > 
    > Aynzo is different. Every one of our 100+ tools (Image, PDF, Dev, SEO) follows a strict **Client-Side First** philosophy. Your images never leave your RAM, and your code snippets stay in your browser.
    > 
    > We'd love to hear your feedback on which tool you'd like us to build next! 🚀"

## 📱 PART 2: Niche Community Outreach (Reddit/HN)

### 1. Hacker News (Show HN)
*   **Headline:** Show HN: Aynzo Tools – 100+ private, ad-free web utilities
*   **Body Copy:**
    > "I built this suite of tools (https://tools.aynzo.com) using Next.js and WebAssembly. The goal was to provide high-performance utilities (like bulk image compression and PDF editing) without ever uploading user files to a server. Everything is processed locally. Would love to get the community's thoughts on the performance and any edge cases you find in the formatters!"

### 2. Reddit Strategy

| **r/design** | Output Quality | "High-quality bulk image compression that runs in your browser. No file size limits." |
| **r/SEO** | Content Growth | "New free toolkit for YouTube SEO: Extract tags, generate viral titles, and check density." |
| **r/privacy** | Zero-Knowledge | "Stop uploading your PDFs to the cloud. This suite merges/splits files 100% locally." |
